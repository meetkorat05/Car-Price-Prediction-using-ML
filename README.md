# Car Price Prediction 

ðŸš€ End-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting the price of cars using Python, scikit-learn and Flask.




## ðŸ“š Project Overview

ðŸ”¹ Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type and other relevant factors.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset:
The dataset used contains historical car listings with attributes like brand, model, year, fuel type, kilometers driven etc.

The data is sourced from Kaggle.
